# MyTodos - To Do App

Welcome! [MyTodos](https://dan-mca.github.io/todo-app/) is a simple To Do app built in React using Styled Components

[https://dan-mca.github.io/todo-app/](https://dan-mca.github.io/todo-app/)

## Requirements
Create a To Do app:
- a user can type their name
- a task can be added
- a list of tasks display which can be edited, selected and deleted
- a user can reset the page back to the default state

<!-- ## Design -->


## Motivation
 
I wanted to learn and use styled components and also take high level requirements to create a mobile responsive react app

## Built With
- React
- Styled Components
<!-- - React Testing Library -->

## Usage

### `npm install`

Install all relevant dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

<!-- ### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information. -->

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
